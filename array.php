            <h2 class='arrayh2'>About me.</h2>
            <p>I'm Aaron Luciano, a photographer based out of Burlington, VT but originally from Boston, Massachusetts.
                I
                specialize in portraits and music/concert photography, but I'm also experienced in landscapes and
                events.
                <br><br>
                My passion for photography started in high school when I picked up a camera for the first time. Since
                then,
                I've honed my craft through years of practice and experimentation. I find that there's something truly
                magical about capturing a moment in time and preserving it forever through photography.
                <br><br>
                As a portrait photographer, I strive to create a comfortable and relaxed environment for my clients,
                allowing them to express their unique personalities and tell their own stories through the photos. I
                also
                enjoy the challenge of capturing the energy and excitement of live music events through my concert
                photography.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my portrait and music work, I'm always looking to capture the beauty of the world around
                us
                through landscapes and events. I love exploring new places and discovering new perspectives, and I find
                that
                photography is the perfect way to share those experiences with others.
                <br><br>
                Whether you're in need of a portrait photographer, concert photographer, or just want to capture a
                special
                moment, I would love to work with you and bring your vision to life.
