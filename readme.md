This repository contains the code for my personal photography website, a passion project that showcases my work and skills as a photographer. Built with a mix of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, the website offers a rich, interactive experience for visitors.

## Project Overview

The website is designed with a clean and responsive layout, ensuring that my photography is presented beautifully across all devices. It features a dynamic gallery, user interaction capabilities, and a backend to manage content.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: Crafted to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices.
- **Dynamic Gallery**: Utilizes JavaScript and PHP to dynamically display photographs. Users can browse through the collection and view images in different categories.
- **Backend Management**: A PHP and SQL backend allows for easy management of the website content, including photo uploads, category management, and descriptions.
- **Contact Form**: A PHP-based contact form allows visitors to reach out directly through the website.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent look.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions and enhanced user experience.
- **PHP**: For server-side scripting, form handling, and content management.
- **SQL**: For database interactions, storing image details, and handling queries.
